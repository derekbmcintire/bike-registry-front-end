# WDI21 Boston Project \#2 - Spoke Retriever

## Overview

[Link to my Project](https://derekbmcintire.github.io/bike-registry-front-end/)

For my second project at General Assembly I needed to build  a full-stack single page application that allowed a user to sign up, sign in, change password, create a resource, read a resource, update a resource, delete a resource and sign out.  I chose to build a site that lets users keep track of their bicycles.  My user stories were:

- A user can create an account and log in.
- A user can change their password and log out.
- A user can register many bicycles.
- A user can see their bicycles displayed.
- A user can see a list of all bicycles.
- A user can see a list of all the bicycles they own.
- A user can update or remove a bicycle.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Ruby on Rails
- Handlebars
- postgreSQL

My front end is deployed on GitHub and the backend is deployed on Heroku.

## Features/Additions

In addition to the basic requirements, I added some special features.

- A user can search through all of the bicycles in the database and return the ones that match their search.

## Updates
I plan to add a join table and allow users to create events with their bicycles.  If their bike is stolen, they can register a stolen event.  If their bicycle is recovered, they can register a recovered event.  I also plan to implement the Google Maps API to show a map of locations where bicycles were stolen.
